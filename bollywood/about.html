        <p>Hindi cinema, popularly known as Bollywood 
            and formerly as Bombay cinema,[4] is the Indian
             Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (
                formerly Bombay). The popular term Bollywood,
                 used to refer to mainstream Hindi cinema,
                  is a portmanteau of "Bombay" and "Hollywood".
                   The industry is part of the larger Indian 
                   cinemaâ€”the world's largest by number of feature 
                   films produced, along with the Cinema of South India
                    and other Indian film industries.

    In 2017, Indian cinema produced 1,986 feature films
    , with the Hindi film industry as its largest filmmaker
    , producing 364 Hindi films the same year.[3] As per data
     from 2014, Hindi cinema represented 43 percent of Indian
      net box-office revenue; Tamil and Telugu cinema represented
       36 percent, and the remaining regional cinema constituted 
       21 percent.[7] Hindi cinema has overtaken the U.S. film industry
        to become the largest centre for film production in the world.
         In 2001 ticket sales, Indian cinema (including Hindi films) 
         reportedly sold an estimated 3.6 billion tickets worldwide,
          compared to Hollywood's 2.6 billion tickets sold.
          Earlier Hindi films tended to use vernacular Hindustani, 
          mutually intelligible by speakers of either Hindi or Urdu, 
          while modern Hindi productions increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish.
